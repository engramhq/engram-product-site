I wanted to build a CLI version of engram since I first started the project.  I delayed it over and over as I figured people would want a traditional UI that they've come to expect.  While I still think this is true to some degree, I found myself wanting a cli version of engram. I can think of no other type of program that is quick, removes distractions, and yet still provides deep advanced functionality.

## Building & Installing engram-cli

If you are interested in how the code works and looks have a look at this post I made about the more techinical details: [Building My First Command Line Interface (CLI) with Rust](https://devtails.medium.com/building-my-first-command-line-interface-cli-with-rust-b6beb9c284e0)

### Pre-requisites

Install rust with the command below found from their [Getting started page](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Install eg command

```
git clone https://github.com/adamjberg/engram-cli.git
cd engram-cli
cd rust
cargo install --path .
```

## Create an engram account

Currently, the cli only works with the online version of engram.  [Sign up for an account here](https://engram.xyzdigital.com/signup).

## Running the `eg` command

If all is successful you can now run `eg` from your favorite terminal program.

On first run the application will ask you for your engram username and password.  These will then be stored in a config file so you never need to re-enter them again.  

Now anytime you run the `eg` command you can type note after note into the terminal and they will be immediately synced to your online account.
