    <h1>Mission</h1>
    <blockquote>
      Helping others build more innovative, efficient and reliable software applications through cloud infrastructure
      and education
    </blockquote>
    <h1>Our Why</h1>
    <h2>Most Cloud Platforms Are More Difficult to Use Than Managing Your Own Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>The major cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) are a confusing web of oddly named products that require hours of
      learning to manage even the simplest of deployments. Contenders like Heroku, Netlify, and Vercel attempt to bridge
      this accessibility gap, and to some degree, succeed. However, in exploring each of these platforms, I'm beginning
      to wonder who they are targeted at. Each one is often too complicated for an early developer, ultimately requiring
      a fair bit of pre-existing DevOps knowledge to know how to use. As a person with a fair bit of pre-existing DevOps
      knowledge, I find myself asking myself why I'm fumbling through documentation learning how to do things I already
      know how to do in the way the platform needs it to be set up. Behind all the fancy product names is the reality
      that all they are doing is moving bits from A to B.</p>

      How Does engram Help Solve This?
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      Innovate at the speed of thought
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      engram doesn't aim to be the forever home for your production infrastructure.  Instead, we help get the ball rolling so you can start testing whether your product is actually worth building and scaling. engram is so fast and simple to use that it will likely replace your local development environment altogether.  New developers can be onboarded instantly and sharing progress with other stakeholders becomes a thing that happens several times a day, rather than at the end of each sprint cycle.

    <h2>Innovation is Dying and Big Tech is to Blame</h2>
    <p>
      We have an innovation problem in the software industry. In 2021, venture capital investment more than doubled from
      $167 billion in 2020 to $332 billion in 2022.<sup><a
          href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277501/venture-capital-amount-invested-in-the-united-states-since-1995/">1</a></sup>
      Meta has already spent $36 billion dollars trying to make VR/AR the next big thing and has not much to show for
      it.<sup><a
          href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-lost-30-billion-on-metaverse-rivals-spent-far-less-2022-10">2</a></sup>
      Many have spent the last decade gambling their money on digital currencies that now account for an estimated 0.4%
      to 0.9% of annual gloabl electricity usage (a number that is continually growing) and are struggling to find a
      useful purpose.<sup><a
          href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09-2022-Crypto-Assets-and-Climate-Report.pdf">3</a></sup>
      Despite killing Flash on the basis that a "third party layer between the platform and the developer results in
      sub-standard apps and hinders the enhancement and progress of the platform",<sup><a
          href="https://newslang.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Thoughts-on-Flash.pdf">4</a></sup> Apple has injected
      themselves as the third party layer and prevented the truly cross-platform browser from reaching its full
      potential in order to protect their own profits.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you boil it all down, has anyone's life really changed all that much since the advent of smartphones in the
      mid 2000s directly because of technology? What has all this "investment" actually produced? A world where the
      first page of Google is entirely ads, Youtube presents an ad (or multiple) on every video, and I can no longer
      actually see what my friends are doing on Instagram because my entire feed is content I have not subscribed to.

      engram (or `eg` in the command line) is a tool to streamline the creation process for developing, hosting, and
      sharing applications for people at all stages of the learning process. In addition to tooling, we will be
      generating high quality learning materials over at <a href="https://devtails.xyz/">devtails.xyz</a> that cover a
      range of topics for various skill levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already released 20 open source projects under our <a href="https://github.com/engramhq">@engramhq github
        organization</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been building web applications for almost a decade now and during this time I have learned lots about how
      to deploy them to "the cloud". There have been some awesome achievements in the realm of infrastructure management
      during that time, but I can't help but think that <b>things have become over complicated</b>.
