### Local Storage

By default, engram is set up to store data locally on your system right out of the box.  This means there is no account necessary and your data remains on your device.  Local storage is provided via [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) which has some quirks depending on the device and browser you are using.  

Unless you have [installed engram to your device](/help/getting-started/install-engram-on-your-devices), you should assume that at some point your local data will be deleted by the browser. For this reason, it is highly recommended that you install the app if you plan to use locally and would like to retain historical data (the app works well as a daily task tracker - so you may not need guaranteed data retention).

### Backups

Data dumps are not currently supported, but will be soon.  These will allow for manual or automated backups so you don't have to worry about losing information.  These will also provide a way to export all of your data from engram in case you would like to move it elsewhere.
